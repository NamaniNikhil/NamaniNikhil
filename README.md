Predicting Customer Churn for a Telecommunication Company          

-Customers churn is an everyday thing with telecom companies, although the percentage rate increased slightly following the pandemic. Our objective is in this project is to create a Machine Learning model that can predict weather a customer is likely to leave the telecom service or notâ€™.In this notebook we are training multiple ML models with customer data from IBM Business Analytics Community. These data sets have all been tested with IBM Cognos Analytics.

-Led ETL processes in Python, harnessing NumPy and Pandas to seamlessly transform and integrate telecom customer data for advanced machine learning model training. Utilized Machine Learning for customer churn prediction, attaining an outstanding 96% Recall using the Decision Tree model.

-Implemented impactful data preprocessing with Random Oversampling, balancing the training set with 3589 instances for churn and non-churn cases.

-Skills : Python,Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Scikit,Machine Learning Agorithms
Tools : Jupyter Notebook
